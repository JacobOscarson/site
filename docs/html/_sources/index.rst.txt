Welcome to Jacob Oscarson's documentation!
==========================================

Hello! This is my little card on the web. My name is Jacob Oscarson
and I'm working with software development (or programming if you
prefer) and technical writing at Glooko, a company working with
Diabetes informatics. Previously, I was a founder and the implementer
of Juntoo, a website annotation tool.
